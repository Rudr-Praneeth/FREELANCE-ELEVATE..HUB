# ELEVATE.HUB LANDING EXPERIENCE

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
> FREELANCE PROJECT

This repository contains the development of a cinematic, animation-driven landing page built for a freelance client. The goal of the project is to deliver a visually immersive, high-impact web experience that reflects modern award-level design standards while maintaining production-grade performance.

The landing page emphasizes fluid motion, interactive depth, and refined visual storytelling to create a strong first impression and elevate perceived brand quality.

## TECH STACK

**Framework**  
Next.js Enables optimized builds, routing, and strong performance characteristics suitable for production environments.

**Animation Engine**  
GSAP Selected for its reliability, sequencing capabilities, and high-performance rendering.

**3D Rendering**  
Three.js Used to create interactive WebGL-powered scenes that enhance visual depth.

**Styling**  
Modern CSS practices with a focus on responsiveness, layout stability, and rendering efficiency.

**Deployment**  
Vercel Recommended platform due to native Next.js support, global edge delivery, automatic CI/CD, and minimal configuration overhead.
